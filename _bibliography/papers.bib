  abstract      = {Ocneanu's tube algebra provides a finite algorithm to compute the Drinfeld center of a fusion category. In this work we reveal the universal property underlying the tube algebra. Take a base category $\mathcal V$ which is strongly concrete, bicomplete, and closed symmetric monoidal. For physical applications one takes $\mathcal V=\mathbf{Vect}$ the category of vector spaces. Given a $\mathcal V$-enriched rigid monoidal category $\mathcal C$ (not necessarily finite or semisimple) we define the tube category $\mathbb X \mathcal C$ using coends valued in $\mathcal V$. Our main theorem established the relation between (the category of representations of) the tube category $\mathbb X \mathcal C$ and the Drinfeld center $Z(\mathcal C)$: $Z(\mathcal C)\hookrightarrow \mathrm{Fun}(\mathbb X \mathcal C^{\mathrm{op}},\mathcal V)\cong Z(\mathcal C\hookrightarrow\mathrm{Fun}(\mathcal C^{\mathrm{op}},\mathcal V))\hookrightarrow Z(\mathrm{Fun}(\mathcal C^{\mathrm{op}},\mathcal V))$. Physically, besides viewing the tube category as a version of TFT with domain being the tube, we emphasize the "Wick-rotated" perspective, that the morphisms in $\mathbb X \mathcal C$ are the local tensors of fixed-point matrix product operators which preserves the symmetry $\mathcal C$ in one spatial dimension. We provide a first-principle flavored construction, from microscopic quantum degrees of freedom and operators preserving the symmetry, to the macroscopic universal properties of the symmetry which form the Drinfeld center. Our work is thus a proof to the 1+1D topological holography in a very general setting.},

  abstract      = {We investigate (1+1)d symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with fusion category symmetries. We emphasize that the UV description of an anomaly-free fusion category symmetry must include the fiber functor, giving rise to a local symmetry action, a charge category and a trivial phase. We construct an ``onsite'' matrix-product-operator (MPO) version of the Hopf algebra symmetry operators in a lattice model with tensor-product Hilbert space. In particular, we propose a systematic framework for classifying and constructing SPTs with non-invertible symmetries. An SPT phase corresponds to a Q-system in the charge category, such that the Q-system becomes a matrix algebra when the symmetry is forgotten. As an example, we provide an explicit microscopic realization of all three $\mathsf{Rep}^\dagger(D_8)$ SPT phases, including a trivial phase, and further demonstrate the $S_3$-duality among these three SPT phases.},

  abstract      = {Given a modular tensor category $\mathscr{C}$, we construct an associative algebra $\mathrm{Tor({\mathscr{C}}})$, which we call the torus algebra. We prove that the torus algebra is semisimple by explicitly constructing all the simple modules. Suppose that a topological ordered phase described by $\mathscr{C}$ is put on a torus. Physically, each simple module over $\mathrm{Tor({\mathscr{C}}})$ consists of the low energy states on the torus with one anyon excitation, or equivalently, the ground states on a punctured torus where the anyon is enclosed by the puncture. Elements in $\mathrm{Tor({\mathscr{C}}})$ can be physically interpreted as anyon hopping processes on the torus. We give the precise formula how an arbitrary logical operator on the low energy states on a torus can be realized by moving anyons on the torus. Our work thus provides a theoretical proposal that the low energy states on a torus can serve as topological qudits and one can arbitrarily manipulate them by moving anyons around.},

Physically, symmetry charges are objects of $\mathcal{C}$ and symmetric operators are morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$. The addition of charges is given by the tensor product of representations. For any symmetric operator $O$ crossing two subsystems, the exact symmetry charge transported by $O$ can be extracted. The quantum current is defined as symmetric operators that can transport symmetry charges over an arbitrary long distance. A quantum current exactly corresponds to an object in the Drinfeld center $Z_1(\mathcal{C})$. The condition for quantum currents to be condensed is also specified. To express the local conservation, the internal hom must be used to compute the charge difference, and the framework of enriched category is inevitable. To illustrate these ideas, we develop a rigorous scheme of renormalization in one-dimensional lattice systems and analyse the fixed-point models. It is proved that in the fixed-point models, condensed quantum currents form a Lagrangian algebra in $Z_1(\mathcal{C})$ and the boundary-bulk correspondence is verified in the enriched setting. Overall, the quantum current provides a natural physical interpretation to the holographic categorical symmetry.},

The complete structure of generalized global symmetry is described by higher fusion category theory. In this paper, We first review the construction of fusion 2-category symmetry $\Sigma \cal B$ where $\cal B$ is a a braided fusion category. In particular, we elaborate on the monoidal structure of $\Sigma \cal B$ which determines fusion rules and controls the dynamics of topological operators/defects. We then take $\Sigma \mathrm{sVec}$ as an example to demonstrate how we calculate fusion rule, quantum dimension and 10j-symbol of the fusion 2-category. With our algorithm, all these data can be efficiently encoded and computed in computer program. The complete program will be uploaded to github soon. Our work can be thought as explicitly computing the representation theory of $\cal B$, in analogy to, for example the representation theory of $SU(2)$. The choice of basis bimodule maps are in analogy to the Clebsch-Gordon coefficients and the 10j-symbol are in analogy to the 6j-symbol.},

  abstract      = {Topological orders are a class of phases of matter that beyond the Landau symmetry breaking paradigm. The two (spatial) dimensional (2d) topological orders have been thoroughly studied. It is known that they can be fully classified by a unitary modular tensor category (UMTC) and a chiral central charge c. And a class of 2d topological orders whose boundary are gappable can be systematically constructed by Levin-Wen model whose ground states are string-net condensed states. Previously, the three spatial dimensional topological orders have been classified based on their canonical boundary described by some special unitary fusion 2-category, $2\mathcal{V}ec_G^\omega$ or an EF 2-category. However, a lattice realization of a three spatial dimensional topological orders with both canonical boundary and arbitrary boundaries are still lacking. In this paper, we construct a 3d membrane-net model based on spherical fusion 2-category, which can be used to systematically study all general 3d topological order with gapped boundary. The partition function and lattice Hamiltonian of the membrane-net model is constructed based on state sum of spherical fusion 2-category. We also construct the 3d tube algebra of the membrane-net model to study excitations in the model. We conjecture all intrinsic excitations in membrane-net model have a one-to-one correspondence with the irreducible central idempotents (ICI) of the 3d tube algebra. We also provide a universal framework to study mutual statistics of all excitations in 3d topological order through 3d tube algebra. Our approach can be straightforwardly generalized to arbitrary dimension.},

We show that an algebraic higher symmetry in a bosonic system in $n$-dimensional space is characterized and classified by a local fusion $n$-category. We find another way to describe algebraic higher symmetry by restricting to symmetric sub Hilbert space where symmetry transformations all become trivial. In this case, algebraic higher symmetry can be fully characterized by a non-invertible gravitational anomaly (i.e. an topological order in one higher dimension). Thus we also refer to non-invertible gravitational anomaly as categorical symmetry to stress its connection to symmetry. This provides a holographic and entanglement view of symmetries. For a system with a categorical symmetry, its gapped state must spontaneously break part (not all) of the symmetry, and the state with the full symmetry must be gapless. Using such a holographic point of view, we obtain (1) the gauging of the algebraic higher symmetry; (2) the classification of anomalies for an algebraic higher symmetry; (3) the equivalence between classes of systems, with different (potentially anomalous) algebraic higher symmetries or different sets of low energy excitations, as long as they have the same categorical symmetry; (4) the classification of gapped liquid phases for bosonic/fermionic systems with a categorical symmetry, as gapped boundaries of a topological order in one higher dimension (that corresponds to the categorical symmetry). This classification includes symmetry protected trivial (SPT) orders and symmetry enriched topological (SET) orders with an algebraic higher symmetry.},

The second approach is to use the 1-dimensional higher bulk of the SPT/SET order and the boundary-bulk relation.

We find that mapping-class-group representations for both genus-1 and genus-2 surfaces are needed to determine the gapped domain walls and boundaries. Our systematic theory is based on the fixed-point partition functions for the walls (or the boundaries), which completely characterize the gapped domain walls (or the boundaries). The mapping-class-group representations give rise to conditions that must be satisfied by the fixed-point partition functions, which leads to a systematic theory. Such conditions can be viewed as bulk topological order determining the (non-invertible) gravitational anomaly at the domain wall, and our theory can be viewed as finding all types of the gapped domain wall given a (non-invertible) gravitational anomaly. We also developed a systematic theory of gapped domain walls (boundaries) based on the structure coefficients of condensable algebras.},

  abstract      = {In this paper, we classify EF topological orders for 3+1D bosonic systems where some emergent pointlike excitations are fermions. (1) We argue that all 3+1D bosonic topological orders have gappable boundary. (2) All the pointlike excitations in EF topological orders are described by the representations of $G_f=Z_2^f\leftthreetimes_{e_2} G_b$ -- a $Z_2^f$ central extension of a finite group $G_b$ characterized by $e_2\in H^2(G_b,Z_2)$. (3) We find that the EF topological orders are classified by 2+1D anomalous topological orders $\mathcal{A}_b^3$ on their unique canonical boundary. Here $\mathcal{A}_b^3$ is a unitary fusion 2-category with simple objects labeled by $\hat G_b=Z_2^m\leftthreetimes G_b$. $\mathcal{A}_b^3$ also has one invertible fermionic 1-morphism for each object as well as quantum-dimension-$\sqrt 2$ 1-morphisms that connect two objects $g$ and $gm$, where $g\in \hat G_b$ and $m$ is the generator of $Z_2^m$. (4) When $\hat G_b$ is the trivial $Z_2^m$ extension, the EF topological orders are called EF1 topological orders, which is classified by simple data $(G_b,e_2,n_3,\nu_4)$. (5) When $\hat G_b$ is a non-trivial $Z_2^m$ extension, the EF topological orders are called EF2 topological orders, where some intersections of three stringlike excitations must carry Majorana zero modes. (6) Every EF2 topological order with $G_f=Z_2^f\leftthreetimes G_b$ can be associated with a EF1 topological order with $G_f=Z_2^f\leftthreetimes \hat G_b$. (7) We find that all EF topological orders correspond to gauged 3+1D fermionic symmetry protected topological (SPT) orders with a finite unitary symmetry group. (8) We further propose that the general classification of 3+1D topological orders with finite unitary symmetries for bosonic and fermionic systems can be obtained by gauging or partially gauging the finite symmetry group of 3+1D SPT phases of bosonic and fermionic systems.},

Those exactly soluble models suggest that phase transitions induced by fluctuations with no topological defects (i.e. fluctuations described by homomorphisms $\phi$) usually produce a topologically ordered state and are topological phase transitions, while phase transitions induced by fluctuations with all the topological defects give rise to trivial product states and are not topological phase transitions. If $K$ is a space with only non-trivial first homotopy group $G$ which is finite, those topological non-linear $\sigma$-models can realize all 3+1D bosonic topological orders without emergent fermions, which are described by Dijkgraaf-Witten theory with gauge group $\pi_1(K)=G$. Here, we show that the 3+1D bosonic topological orders with emergent fermions can be realized by topological non-linear $\sigma$-models with $\pi_1(K)=$ finite groups, $\pi_2(K)=Z_2$, and $\pi_{n>2}(K)=0$. A subset of those topological non-linear $\sigma$-models corresponds to 2-gauge theories, which realize and classify bosonic topological orders with emergent fermions that have no emergent Majorana zero modes at triple string intersections. The classification of 3+1D bosonic topological orders may correspond to a classification of unitary fully dualizable fully extended topological quantum field theories in 4-dimensions.},

In this paper, we propose a classification of 2+1D GQL for both bosonic and fermionic systems: 2+1D bosonic/fermionic GQLs with finite on-site symmetry are classified by non-degenerate unitary braided fusion categories over a symmetric fusion category (SFC) $\cal E$, abbreviated as $\text{UMTC}_{/\cal E}$, together with their modular extensions and total chiral central charges. The SFC $\cal E$ is $\text{Rep}(G)$ for bosonic symmetry $G$, or $\text{sRep}(G^f)$ for fermionic symmetry $G^f$. As a special case of the above result, we find that the modular extensions of $\text{Rep}(G)$ classify the 2+1D bosonic SPT states of symmetry $G$, while the $c=0$ modular extensions of $\text{sRep}(G^f)$ classify the 2+1D fermionic SPT states of symmetry $G^f$. Many fermionic SPT states are studied based on the constructions from free-fermion models. But it is not clear if free-fermion constructions can produce all fermionic SPT states. Our classification does not have such a drawback. We show that, for interacting 2+1D fermionic systems, there are exactly 16 superconducting phases with no symmetry and no fractional excitations (up to $E_8$ bosonic quantum Hall states). Also, there are exactly 8 $Z_2\times Z_2^f$-SPT phases, 2 $Z_8^f$-SPT phases, and so on. Besides, we show that two topological orders with identical bulk excitations and central charge always differ by the stacking of the SPT states of the same symmetry.},

We also prove that the set $\mathcal{M}_{ext}(\mathcal{C})$ of all modular extensions of $\mathcal{C}$, if not empty, is equipped with a natural $\mathcal{M}_{ext}(\mathcal{E})$-action that is free and transitive. Namely, the set $\mathcal{M}_{ext}(\mathcal{C})$ is an $\mathcal{M}_{ext}(\mathcal{E})$-torsor. As special cases, we explain in details how the group $\mathcal{M}_{ext}(\mathcal{E})$ recovers the well-known group-cohomology classification of the 2+1D bosonic SPT orders and Kitaev's 16 fold ways. We also discuss briefly the behavior of the group $\mathcal{M}_{ext}(\mathcal{E})$ under the symmetry-breaking processes and its relation to Witt groups.},

Each non-Abelian family has one or a few root topological orders with the smallest number of anyon types. All the Abelian topological orders belong to the trivial non-Abelian family whose root is the trivial topological order. We show that Abelian anyons in root topological orders must be bosons or fermions with trivial mutual statistics between them. The classification of topological orders is then greatly simplified, by focusing on the roots of each family: those roots are given by non-Abelian modular extensions of representation categories of Abelian groups.},

Here, we show how to identify distinct topological orders via measuring their modular $S$ and $T$ matrices. In particular, we employ a nuclear magnetic resonance quantum simulator to study the properties of three topologically ordered matter phases described by the string-net model with two string types, including the $\Z_2$ toric code, doubled semion, and doubled Fibonacci order. The third one, non-Abelian Fibonacci order is notably expected to be the simplest candidate for universal topological quantum computing. Our experiment serves as the basic module, built on which one can simulate braiding of non-Abelian anyons and ultimately topological quantum computation via the braiding, and thus provides a new approach of investigating topological orders using quantum computers.},

Our criteria also determine which (2+1)D topological orders must have gapless edge modes, namely, which (1+1)D global gravitational anomalies ensure gaplessness. Furthermore, we introduce a new mathematical object, the tunneling matrix W, whose entries are the fusion-space dimensions W(ia), to label different types of gapped domain walls. By studying many examples, we find evidence that the tunneling matrices are powerful quantities to classify different types of gapped domain walls. Since a gapped boundary is a gapped domain wall between a bulk topological order and the vacuum, regarded as the trivial topological order, our theory of gapped domain walls inclusively contains the theory of gapped boundaries. In addition, we derive a topological ground state degeneracy formula, applied to arbitrary orientable spatial 2-manifolds with gapped domain walls, including closed 2-manifolds and open 2-manifolds with gapped boundaries.},

  abstract      = {String-net models allow us to systematically construct and classify 2+1D topologically ordered states which can have gapped boundaries. We can use a simple ideal string-net wavefunction, which is described by a set of F-matrices [or more precisely, a unitary fusion category (UFC)], to study all the universal properties of such a topological order. In this paper, we describe a finite computational method -- Q-algebra approach, that allows us to compute the non-Abelian statistics of the topological excitations [or more precisely, the unitary modular tensor category (UMTC)], from the string-net wavefunction (or the UFC). We discuss several examples, including the topological phases described by twisted gauge theory (i.e., twisted quantum double $D^\alpha(G)$). Our result can also be viewed from an angle of holographic bulk-boundary relation. The 1+1D anomalous topological orders, that can appear as edges of 2+1D topological states, are classified by UFCs which describe the fusion of quasiparticles in 1+1D. The 1+1D anomalous edge topological order uniquely determines the 2+1D bulk topological order (which are classified by UMTC). Our method allows us to compute this bulk topological order (i.e., the UMTC) from the anomalous edge topological order (i.e., the UFC).},
