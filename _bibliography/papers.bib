  abstract      = {Given a modular tensor category $\mathscr{C}$, we construct an associative algebra $\mathrm{Tor({\mathscr{C}}})$, which we call the torus algebra. We prove that the torus algebra is semisimple by explicitly constructing all the simple modules. Suppose that a topological ordered phase described by $\mathscr{C}$ is put on a torus. Physically, each simple module over $\mathrm{Tor({\mathscr{C}}})$ consists of the low energy states on the torus with one anyon excitation, or equivalently, the ground states on a punctured torus where the anyon is enclosed by the puncture. Elements in $\mathrm{Tor({\mathscr{C}}})$ can be physically interpreted as anyon hopping processes on the torus. We give the precise formula how an arbitrary logical operator on the low energy states on a torus can be realized by moving anyons on the torus. Our work thus provides a theoretical proposal that the low energy states on a torus can serve as topological qudits and one can arbitrarily manipulate them by moving anyons around.},

  abstract      = {We establish the formulation for quantum current. Given a symmetry group $G$, let $\mathcal{C}:=\mathrm{Rep}\, G$ be its representation category. Physically, symmetry charges are objects of $\mathcal{C}$ and symmetric operators are morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$. The addition of charges is given by the tensor product of representations. For any symmetric operator $O$ crossing two subsystems, the exact symmetry charge transported by $O$ can be extracted. The quantum current is defined as symmetric operators that can transport symmetry charges over an arbitrary long distance. A quantum current exactly corresponds to an object in the Drinfeld center $Z_1(\mathcal{C})$. The condition for quantum currents to be condensed is also specified. To express the local conservation, the internal hom must be used to compute the charge difference, and the framework of enriched category is inevitable. To illustrate these ideas, we develop a rigorous scheme of renormalization in one-dimensional lattice systems and analyse the fixed-point models. It is proved that in the fixed-point models, condensed quantum currents form a Lagrangian algebra in $Z_1(\mathcal{C})$ and the boundary-bulk correspondence is verified in the enriched setting. Overall, the quantum current provides a natural physical interpretation to the holographic categorical symmetry.},

  abstract      = {Recently, many studies are focused on generalized global symmetry, a mixture of both invertible and non-invertible symmetries in various space-time dimensions. The complete structure of generalized global symmetry is described by higher fusion category theory. In this paper, We first review the construction of fusion 2-category symmetry $\Sigma \cal B$ where $\cal B$ is a a braided fusion category. In particular, we elaborate on the monoidal structure of $\Sigma \cal B$ which determines fusion rules and controls the dynamics of topological operators/defects. We then take $\Sigma \mathrm{sVec}$ as an example to demonstrate how we calculate fusion rule, quantum dimension and 10j-symbol of the fusion 2-category. With our algorithm, all these data can be efficiently encoded and computed in computer program. The complete program will be uploaded to github soon. Our work can be thought as explicitly computing the representation theory of $\cal B$, in analogy to, for example the representation theory of $SU(2)$. The choice of basis bimodule maps are in analogy to the Clebsch-Gordon coefficients and the 10j-symbol are in analogy to the 6j-symbol.},

  abstract      = {Topological orders are a class of phases of matter that beyond the Landau symmetry breaking paradigm. The two (spatial) dimensional (2d) topological orders have been thoroughly studied. It is known that they can be fully classified by a unitary modular tensor category (UMTC) and a chiral central charge c. And a class of 2d topological orders whose boundary are gappable can be systematically constructed by Levin-Wen model whose ground states are string-net condensed states. Previously, the three spatial dimensional topological orders have been classified based on their canonical boundary described by some special unitary fusion 2-category, $2\mathcal{V}ec_G^\omega$ or an EF 2-category. However, a lattice realization of a three spatial dimensional topological orders with both canonical boundary and arbitrary boundaries are still lacking. In this paper, we construct a 3d membrane-net model based on spherical fusion 2-category, which can be used to systematically study all general 3d topological order with gapped boundary. The partition function and lattice Hamiltonian of the membrane-net model is constructed based on state sum of spherical fusion 2-category. We also construct the 3d tube algebra of the membrane-net model to study excitations in the model. We conjecture all intrinsic excitations in membrane-net model have a one-to-one correspondence with the irreducible central idempotents (ICI) of the 3d tube algebra. We also provide a universal framework to study mutual statistics of all excitations in 3d topological order through 3d tube algebra. Our approach can be straightforwardly generalized to arbitrary dimension.},

We show that an algebraic higher symmetry in a bosonic system in $n$-dimensional space is characterized and classified by a local fusion $n$-category. We find another way to describe algebraic higher symmetry by restricting to symmetric sub Hilbert space where symmetry transformations all become trivial. In this case, algebraic higher symmetry can be fully characterized by a non-invertible gravitational anomaly (i.e. an topological order in one higher dimension). Thus we also refer to non-invertible gravitational anomaly as categorical symmetry to stress its connection to symmetry. This provides a holographic and entanglement view of symmetries. For a system with a categorical symmetry, its gapped state must spontaneously break part (not all) of the symmetry, and the state with the full symmetry must be gapless. Using such a holographic point of view, we obtain (1) the gauging of the algebraic higher symmetry; (2) the classification of anomalies for an algebraic higher symmetry; (3) the equivalence between classes of systems, with different (potentially anomalous) algebraic higher symmetries or different sets of low energy excitations, as long as they have the same categorical symmetry; (4) the classification of gapped liquid phases for bosonic/fermionic systems with a categorical symmetry, as gapped boundaries of a topological order in one higher dimension (that corresponds to the categorical symmetry). This classification includes symmetry protected trivial (SPT) orders and symmetry enriched topological (SET) orders with an algebraic higher symmetry.},

This 2d result immediately generalizes to all dimensions except in 1d, which is treated with special care. The second approach is to use the 1-dimensional higher bulk of the SPT/SET order and the boundary-bulk relation. This approach also leads us to a precise mathematical description and a classification of SPT/SET orders in all dimensions. The equivalence of these two approaches, together with known physical results, provides us with many precise mathematical predictions.},

We find that mapping-class-group representations for both genus-1 and genus-2 surfaces are needed to determine the gapped domain walls and boundaries. Our systematic theory is based on the fixed-point partition functions for the walls (or the boundaries), which completely characterize the gapped domain walls (or the boundaries). The mapping-class-group representations give rise to conditions that must be satisfied by the fixed-point partition functions, which leads to a systematic theory. Such conditions can be viewed as bulk topological order determining the (non-invertible) gravitational anomaly at the domain wall, and our theory can be viewed as finding all types of the gapped domain wall given a (non-invertible) gravitational anomaly. We also developed a systematic theory of gapped domain walls (boundaries) based on the structure coefficients of condensable algebras.},

  abstract      = {A discrete non-linear $\sigma$-model is obtained by triangulate both the space-time $M^{d+1}$ and the target space $K$. If the path integral is given by the sum of all the complex homomorphisms $\phi: M^{d+1} \to K$, with an partition function that is independent of space-time triangulation, then the corresponding non-linear $\sigma$-model will be called topological non-linear $\sigma$-model which is exactly soluble. Those exactly soluble models suggest that phase transitions induced by fluctuations with no topological defects (i.e. fluctuations described by homomorphisms $\phi$) usually produce a topologically ordered state and are topological phase transitions, while phase transitions induced by fluctuations with all the topological defects give rise to trivial product states and are not topological phase transitions. If $K$ is a space with only non-trivial first homotopy group $G$ which is finite, those topological non-linear $\sigma$-models can realize all 3+1D bosonic topological orders without emergent fermions, which are described by Dijkgraaf-Witten theory with gauge group $\pi_1(K)=G$. Here, we show that the 3+1D bosonic topological orders with emergent fermions can be realized by topological non-linear $\sigma$-models with $\pi_1(K)=$ finite groups, $\pi_2(K)=Z_2$, and $\pi_{n>2}(K)=0$. A subset of those topological non-linear $\sigma$-models corresponds to 2-gauge theories, which realize and classify bosonic topological orders with emergent fermions that have no emergent Majorana zero modes at triple string intersections. The classification of 3+1D bosonic topological orders may correspond to a classification of unitary fully dualizable fully extended topological quantum field theories in 4-dimensions.},

In recent years, it was shown that in 1+1D bosonic systems there is no nontrivial topological order, while in 2+1D bosonic systems the topological orders are classified by a pair: a modular tensor category and a chiral central charge. In this paper, we propose a partial classification of topological orders for 3+1D bosonic systems: If all the point-like excitations are bosons, then such topological orders are classified by unitary pointed fusion 2-categories, which are one-to-one labeled by a finite group $G$ and its group 4-cocycle $\omega_4 \in \mathcal H^4[G;U(1)]$ up to group automorphisms. Furthermore, all such 3+1D topological orders can be realized by Dijkgraaf-Witten gauge theories.},

Here $\mathcal E$ is a symmetric fusion category, $\mathcal E=\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ for boson systems or $\mathcal E=\mathrm{sRep}(G^f)$ for fermion systems, consisting of the representations of the symmetry group and describing the local excitations with symmetry; $\mathcal C$ is the category of all the quasiparticle excitations in the bulk, containing $\mathcal E$ as its M\"uger center; $\mathcal M$ is a minimal modular extension of $\mathcal C$, that also includes the gauged symmetry defects. We also study the stacking of topological phases with symmetry and two types of anyon condensations based on such classification.},

  abstract      = {Gapped quantum liquids (GQL) include both topologically ordered states (with long range entanglement) and symmetry protected topological (SPT) states (with short range entanglement). In this paper, we propose a classification of 2+1D GQL for both bosonic and fermionic systems: 2+1D bosonic/fermionic GQLs with finite on-site symmetry are classified by non-degenerate unitary braided fusion categories over a symmetric fusion category (SFC) $\cal E$, abbreviated as $\text{UMTC}_{/\cal E}$, together with their modular extensions and total chiral central charges. The SFC $\cal E$ is $\text{Rep}(G)$ for bosonic symmetry $G$, or $\text{sRep}(G^f)$ for fermionic symmetry $G^f$. As a special case of the above result, we find that the modular extensions of $\text{Rep}(G)$ classify the 2+1D bosonic SPT states of symmetry $G$, while the $c=0$ modular extensions of $\text{sRep}(G^f)$ classify the 2+1D fermionic SPT states of symmetry $G^f$. Many fermionic SPT states are studied based on the constructions from free-fermion models. But it is not clear if free-fermion constructions can produce all fermionic SPT states. Our classification does not have such a drawback. We show that, for interacting 2+1D fermionic systems, there are exactly 16 superconducting phases with no symmetry and no fractional excitations (up to $E_8$ bosonic quantum Hall states). Also, there are exactly 8 $Z_2\times Z_2^f$-SPT phases, 2 $Z_8^f$-SPT phases, and so on. Besides, we show that two topological orders with identical bulk excitations and central charge always differ by the stacking of the SPT states of the same symmetry.},

In the case $\mathcal{C}=\mathcal{E}$, we prove that the set $\mathcal{M}_{ext}(\mathcal{E})$ of all modular extensions of $\mathcal{E}$ has a natural structure of a finite abelian group. We also prove that the set $\mathcal{M}_{ext}(\mathcal{C})$ of all modular extensions of $\mathcal{C}$, if not empty, is equipped with a natural $\mathcal{M}_{ext}(\mathcal{E})$-action that is free and transitive. Namely, the set $\mathcal{M}_{ext}(\mathcal{C})$ is an $\mathcal{M}_{ext}(\mathcal{E})$-torsor. As special cases, we explain in details how the group $\mathcal{M}_{ext}(\mathcal{E})$ recovers the well-known group-cohomology classification of the 2+1D bosonic SPT orders and Kitaev's 16 fold ways. We also discuss briefly the behavior of the group $\mathcal{M}_{ext}(\mathcal{E})$ under the symmetry-breaking processes and its relation to Witt groups.},

We refer to the corresponding equivalent class (the orbit of the hierarchy construction) as "the non-Abelian family". Each non-Abelian family has one or a few root topological orders with the smallest number of anyon types. All the Abelian topological orders belong to the trivial non-Abelian family whose root is the trivial topological order. We show that Abelian anyons in root topological orders must be bosons or fermions with trivial mutual statistics between them. The classification of topological orders is then greatly simplified, by focusing on the roots of each family: those roots are given by non-Abelian modular extensions of representation categories of Abelian groups.},

Conversely, a quantum simulator, often regarded as a quantum computing device for special purposes, also offers a way of characterizing topological orders. Here, we show how to identify distinct topological orders via measuring their modular $S$ and $T$ matrices. In particular, we employ a nuclear magnetic resonance quantum simulator to study the properties of three topologically ordered matter phases described by the string-net model with two string types, including the $\Z_2$ toric code, doubled semion, and doubled Fibonacci order. The third one, non-Abelian Fibonacci order is notably expected to be the simplest candidate for universal topological quantum computing. Our experiment serves as the basic module, built on which one can simulate braiding of non-Abelian anyons and ultimately topological quantum computation via the braiding, and thus provides a new approach of investigating topological orders using quantum computers.},

Our criteria also determine which (2+1)D topological orders must have gapless edge modes, namely, which (1+1)D global gravitational anomalies ensure gaplessness. Furthermore, we introduce a new mathematical object, the tunneling matrix W, whose entries are the fusion-space dimensions W(ia), to label different types of gapped domain walls. By studying many examples, we find evidence that the tunneling matrices are powerful quantities to classify different types of gapped domain walls. Since a gapped boundary is a gapped domain wall between a bulk topological order and the vacuum, regarded as the trivial topological order, our theory of gapped domain walls inclusively contains the theory of gapped boundaries. In addition, we derive a topological ground state degeneracy formula, applied to arbitrary orientable spatial 2-manifolds with gapped domain walls, including closed 2-manifolds and open 2-manifolds with gapped boundaries.},

We discuss several examples, including the topological phases described by twisted gauge theory (i.e., twisted quantum double $D^\alpha(G)$). Our result can also be viewed from an angle of holographic bulk-boundary relation. The 1+1D anomalous topological orders, that can appear as edges of 2+1D topological states, are classified by UFCs which describe the fusion of quasiparticles in 1+1D. The 1+1D anomalous edge topological order uniquely determines the 2+1D bulk topological order (which are classified by UMTC). Our method allows us to compute this bulk topological order (i.e., the UMTC) from the anomalous edge topological order (i.e., the UFC).},
