*Undergraduate* 

I am starting my Masters at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in the coming August! My research interests lies within the elegance of mathematical physics and some exciting applications of category theory. I have recently written the manuscript around Torus algebra with Tian and Linqian, feel free to check it out! One more fact about me is that I am also an active member of experimental group called the Quantum Matter Group here! My dream is to one showcase the abstract beauty in mathematics into the rigid world! So donâ€™t gauge me away just yet!
