*Undergraduate* 

My name is Kelly and I am an undergraduate student in Professor Lanâ€™s group. The idea of focusing on morphisms - the relations between objects, rather than the internal structure has greatly impressed me. While some may find it too abstract, I think it is quite interesting.

I am currently working on topological quantum computation in gapped boundaries, where the topological bulk meets the boundary of the hole. I am studying the categorical structure of gapped boundaries.

In daily time, I love cooking so much. If you cannot find me in the campus, maybe I am in the kitchen!
