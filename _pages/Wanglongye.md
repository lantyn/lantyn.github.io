 *PhD Candidate* 

I am a PhD student in The Chinese University of Hong Kong. My study is mainly focus on topological phases and category theory. More concretely, my recent research is on condensation theory and 2-category, such as condensation completion of a modular tensor category (a paper arXiv:2402.19253 in collaboration with Tian Lan, Gen Yue) and an ongoing project about using a lattice realization of separable algebras in a fusion 2-category. Another work (arXiv:2312.15958v2) is also in collaboration with Tian Lan, Gen Yue about a category of SET orders.
